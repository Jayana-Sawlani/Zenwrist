# ZenWrist — Wearable System for ADHD & Anxiety

ZenWrist is a wearable prototype developed to help track ADHD- and anxiety-related physiological signals.  
It uses sensors that capture EDA (Electrodermal Activity), HRV (Heart Rate Variability), and IMU motion data to understand stress trends in real time.
